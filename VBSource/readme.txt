To All:

	This is what I started out with when I was first cracking stuff,
using a VB Disassembler on older programs, even newer ones, and then
reverse engineering the source code from there :) It's not what you'd
call real cracking, but it did work and I cracked quite a few programs
this way.  The lamest thing I did tho, was to write these keygens in
VB themselves, but I was lazy and didn't want to have to rewrite the code
for Pascal/Asm. So this is what you get, the code is written for VB4 and
I'm not sure if it will even compile with the newer versions, it should
but there's no garuntee.
